## Overview
The following design outlines a Python Flask web application that will address the specified requirements: creating a website with two text boxes using Bootstrap as the frontend framework.

### HTML Files

Two HTML files are required:
- `index.html`: The main page of the website, which will contain the two text boxes and necessary Bootstrap elements.
- `base.html`: A base template that provides a consistent layout for both the `index.html` and any additional pages that may be added in the future.

### Routes

Multiple routes are needed to handle different actions and display appropriate pages:

- `@app.route('/')`: The home route, which will display the `index.html` page.
- `@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])`: A route to handle form submissions from the `index.html` page. This route will receive the data from the text boxes and perform any necessary actions (e.g., saving the data to a database or displaying it on another page).

### Bootstrap Integration

Bootstrap will be integrated into the `index.html` page using the following:

- A CDN link to the Bootstrap CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery files.
- HTML classes and attributes to style the page elements (e.g., `container`, `form-control`, `btn`).
- A basic page layout consisting of a header, main content area, and footer.

### Additional Considerations

- The Flask application should be configured to use a template folder where both the `index.html` and `base.html` files will reside.
- The submitted data from the text boxes should be validated and handled appropriately.
- The CSS and JavaScript files should be minified and combined for optimized performance.

By implementing this design, you will create a functional and aesthetically pleasing website that meets your requirements using Flask and Bootstrap.
